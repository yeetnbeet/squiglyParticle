Welcome to squigly particle.

The arrow keys accelerate the particle in the direct of the key (Up,down,left,Right).

The particle is described by rocket{} you can change the mass:value and thrust:value to change the movement characteristics.
It's all based on Newtonian Physics.

have fun with this Janky simulation... I might add a rainbow trail effect soon or make the trail an indicator of velocity who knows...
